## What is burnout?

* Being overworked...
* From https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/burnout: Burnout is a state of emotional, mental, and often physical exhaustion brought on by prolonged or repeated stress. Though itâ€™s most often caused by problems at work, it can also appear in other areas of life, such as parenting, caretaking, or romantic relationships.
* lethargy - A lack of interest or enthusiasm; apathy
* cynicism - An attitude of scornful or jaded negativity, especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others.
