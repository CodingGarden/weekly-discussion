## Should you use TypeScript?

> Are you using TypeScript in your JavaScript project? If so, why? If not, why not? What are some benefits you've noticed of using TypeScript? What are some downfalls? If you haven't started using TypeScript, what is stopping you from making the switch?

  * Don't have a current project (20%)
* Twitch Poll (8 votes)

#### If so, why? If not, why not?

* Why are you using it?
  * Editor Support
  * Built in documentation...
  * Type Safety for working with Web APIs
    * (expand on this...)
  * Avoid silly / simple mistakes
  * Typed code is easier for others to follow
  * Incrementally adopt / turn off or ignore if its wrong or in the way
* Why are you not using it?
  * Sometimes overcomplicated...
  * Sometimes the types are hard to express
  * If your project is a library that other people use... and there are complex internal and generic types
  * Generics and other type foo can be hard to read and write
  * Beginner / learning JavaScript

### If you haven't started using TypeScript, what is stopping you from making the switch?

* TypeScript gets in the way
* It is more code to write
* For small one off projects, I still don't use TypeScript
* For quick prototyping, quick scripts - I still don't use TypeScript
* Setup is not always easy...
